# Pythonism

### Overview

* Files end with `.py` 
* Uses _**indentation**_ to indicate block
* Dynamically typed variables and created only after value is assigned to it
* Can use `""` or `''` for string variables
* Comment with `#` 
* Has 3 type of number \(int `1` , float `1.1`, and complex `1j` \)
* Can use `type()` function to get type of variable
* Casting done using constructor function `int()` `float()` `str()` 
* Can assign multi line string using 3 single `''' '''` or double `""" """` quotes
* String are array of string
* Set of built-in string util methods [https://www.w3schools.com/python/python\_ref\_string.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_string.asp)
* logical operator uses \(`and` `or` `not()` \)
*  `is` and `is not` operator can be used to check if object are same and they point to same memory location 
* `in` and `not in` operator can be used to check if a sequence exist inside another variableC

### Collections

* **List** is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members. \(_Like_ `array`\)
  * `["example", "of", "list"]`
  * List built-in methods : [https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)
* **Tuple** is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members. \(_Property similar to Immutable/Cons_t\)
  * `("example", "of", "tuple")`
* **Set** is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
  * `{"example", "of", "set"}`
  * Once set is created - we can't change the items but can add/remove the items
* **Dictionary** is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. No duplicate members.
  * {"name": "example", "second\_name": "of", "last\_name": "dictionary"}
  * Key and Value mapping
