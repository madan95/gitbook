# Elastic-search

#### Intro

Uses [Apache Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/) search engine in core. [JSON Based Query](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl.html), Schema-less & Distributed \(Shards\) .

Can use aggregations alongside search requests \( we can search documents, filter results, and perform aggregations on that search context \).

* **Document**: Collection of fields in the key-value pairs containing our data
* **Indexed:** Document stored \(Optimised collection of documents\)
* **Shards:** Divided indices \(data\) into different nodes\(servers\) of a cluster for horizontal scaling
