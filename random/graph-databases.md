# Graph Databases

### Intro

GD are NoSQL Database. Stores Data based on Graph Concepts \( Vertex, Edges, Properties\). Relationship are first class Entities \( Can store properties in relationship \).

Useful on multi relationship scenario \( Solves complexity of multi relation / Indirect relation traversing in Relational Database \). Flexible for continuously changing Data. Efficiently navigate through connected data.

#### Nodes \( Vertices \)

* \(Labels\) Type 
* Properties \( Key = "Value" Pairs \)
* Doesn't force schema \( Properties of 2 Different Node of Same Label / Type doesn't need to have same properties \)

#### Relationship \( Edges \)

* Type \( Type of relationship \) 
* Properties
* Connects Nodes
* Has Direction \( Bi-Directional, Uni-Directional, Direction it faces \)
